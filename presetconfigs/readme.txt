HOW TO INSTALL:
Simply choose and download a zip, navigate to your mod pack instance, and unzip the contents of this zip file into the main directory.
The Config folder here should merge with the Config folder in your mod pack install, overwriting some files.
You can even make a new profile, fresh install the mod pack, rename it to something like "RLCraft with LycanitesTweaks" and install this config over the new install, which is recommended.

No Scaled Mobs - Config for an experience without "Player Mob Levels" scaling
This is the recommended config to use if you are playing RLCraft.
Content that doesn't really fit or Shivaxi would hate is removed, such as the Soulkey Altar for Creepers that appears in the added "Altars" Beastiary Tab.
THIS CONFIG REPLACES LYCANITES DUNGEON SCHEMATICS, balancing so that the level progression of Dungeon Bosses makes sense, DO NOT REPLACE IF THE PACK NEEDS THEIR COPY SUCH AS WITH RLCraft Dregora.
THIS CONFIG INCLUDES AN InControl CONFIG FILE, optional for boosting underground nighttime mob levels, DO NOT REPLACE IF THE PACK IS USING IT SUCH AS WITH RLCraft Dregora.
Vanilla Lycanites
    * Dungeons - Addressed the crazy level spread such as final room bosses being level 10 to level 250. All Dungeon bosses use Rare Variant stats, the Boss Damage Limit, and are between level 20-50.
    * Fixed Ettin Club and Wildkin Arm melee cooldown becoming significantly worse due to "damageCooldown" increasing per level.
    * Gave Wildkin Arm the secondary ability it was given in Update 2.0.8.5 from Feb 15, 2022
LycanitesTweaks
    * Disabled all additional soulkey altars, only the original Vanilla Lycanites remain
    * Disabled the Charge Shooting Staff (Dynamic Surroundings makes it sound like a bow)
    * Explicitly disabled all "Player Mob Levels" related configs, the automatic scaling to a player's relative power level.
    * Explicitly disabled "Register SpawnedAsBoss With Levels Loot Tables", the loot table meant for Player Mob Levels
    * Disabled feeding Battle Burritos and Explorer's Risottos to pets to change their sizes
    * Disabled setting mob variants with Soulkeys as unnecessary without stat min-maxing for Player Mob Levels
